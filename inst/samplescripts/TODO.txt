# Add function for wavelet power vs time
# motiongram - displacement gives velocity - include in data prep walkthrough
# Add periodicity FFT plot to data analysis walkthrough
# Package checks (include documentation)
# Look at some possible conditional granger implementations - modify lmtest?
# If interior NAs in filter issue warning and interpolate
# Check splice data.frames really are Splice objects in functions
# Splicing for proportion of interval on metre objects
# Option for arrows both ways on influencing plots
# Periodicity - restrict time domain, windowed 10s version
# Order onsetselected data
# Generalise autolayer to accept parameters or expr - done for splice_time.Duration - others?

# DONE
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 5 - no interpolation on feature data
# Infer wavelet the relative phase of two ts - autolayer overlays on window plot, add reference lines to
# function call, phase angle degrees in summary
# Moved walk-through scripts to inst directory
# Changed in naming on data files - NS to Pose - uploaded new data to Google drive
# If data 3D use _z cordinate then calculate d for both processed and filtered data
# Updated default onsetselected graphs, added autoplots
# Adhoc feature data can be loaded and joined
# Generated a reference beat time point from the mean
# Tabular summary functions: added simple summary function to analyze.wavelet - maybe output table as CSV?
# Rename Tier column as Segment in splicing tables
# difference based Inst, + others and add differences in time as columns
# mean sd, mean of absolute  from second object
# subset onset and summary on sections in annotation
# Added number of non NA rows in onset summaries
# Added clip_splice function to take in splice return a new windowed splice
# For sampling use two plots - originals vs samples or A vs B
# Added default data set to package
# Added a clip_slice function to generate splicing table from annotation data such that segments of equal length
# Added set operations on Splicing tables
# Lags in seconds in Granger code are rounded to nearest frame
# Other signal filters can be applied to processed data now
