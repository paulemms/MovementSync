# TODO
# Add conditional granger implementations by modifying lmtest.
# Option for arrows both ways on influencing plots
# Update the show_plot type graphs to have similar features to other plots - see ave_power_spliceview
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 1
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 2
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 3
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 4
# See Martin email on modification of Metre object for Tempo
# Check splice data.frames really are Splice objects in functions
# Splicing for proportion of interval on metre objects
# Order onsetselected data
# Generalise autolayer to accept parameters or expr - done for splice_time.Duration - others?
# Single time series autoplot has z axis label see section 5.

# DONE
# Package checks (include documentation) - add man pages
# Only applied filters to interior numeric data - added unit test
# Add time_limits to autoplots and autolayers - done duration layer and onsetsselected
# Replace Tala by Metre for beat in function calls and plots
# Replace Matra by Tactus for beat in function calls and plots
# Updated names of Metre files on google drive.
# Email on structure of duration data in 5th reordering to Martin
# Added periodicity FFT plot to data analysis walkthrough
# Added motiongram plots to data prep walkthrough
# Martin Word Doc 10122022 Section 5 - added interpolate feature which is by default off.
# Fixed Metre default plot at end
# Added function for wavelet power vs time - included in walkthrough script
# Infer wavelet the relative phase of two ts - autolayer overlays on window plot, add reference lines to
# function call, phase angle degrees in summary
# Moved walk-through scripts to inst directory
# Changed in naming on data files - NS to Pose - uploaded new data to Google drive
# If data 3D use _z cordinate then calculate d for both processed and filtered data
# Updated default onsetselected graphs, added autoplots
# Adhoc feature data can be loaded and joined
# Generated a reference beat time point from the mean
# Tabular summary functions: added simple summary function to analyze.wavelet - maybe output table as CSV?
# Rename Tier column as Segment in splicing tables
# difference based Inst, + others and add differences in time as columns
# mean sd, mean of absolute  from second object
# subset onset and summary on sections in annotation
# Added number of non NA rows in onset summaries
# Added clip_splice function to take in splice return a new windowed splice
# For sampling use two plots - originals vs samples or A vs B
# Added default data set to package
# Added a clip_slice function to generate splicing table from annotation data such that segments of equal length
# Added set operations on Splicing tables
# Lags in seconds in Granger code are rounded to nearest frame
# Other signal filters can be applied to processed data now
