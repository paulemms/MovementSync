# DONE
# Added in duration annotation CSV for NIRP1_MAK_Jaun - updated diagnostic plot
# Add influence diagram (p-value arrows) to package library
# Scripted igraph influence graph
# Scripted some wavelet plots
# Looked at some possible conditional granger implementations

# TODO
# period in seconds divide by fps
# option to make the split time durations unique by appending a number
# Bar widths on p-value plot reflect time interval?
# Modify duration object to annotate with granger tests
# Limit colour to panels for GrangerTime - curently in script
# conditional granger time in R packages ? - possibly adapt FIAR package implementation
# infer wavelet the relative phase of two ts
# maybe some other filters?
# wrist (faster) and nose focus as points -lag over a second, 2 or 3 seconds nose
# motiongram - displacement gives velocity
# * Added periodicity FFT plot - yet to do windowing
# grangers - extension - stats ?, vars, lmtest - tables - p number against time
# periodicity - restrict time domain, windowed 10s version
# overlay audio onto video - autolayers - test on last performance - stack the rects for inst?
# gganimate? https://rpubs.com/jedoenriquez/animatingchartsintro - on processed
# order onsetselected data
# Generalise autolayer to accept parameters or expr
# Generalise interpolation methods
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68022639/combining-time-trend-plot-with-timeline
# dedicated zoo methods?
# Make the scripts in test/ reflect sections of the spec
